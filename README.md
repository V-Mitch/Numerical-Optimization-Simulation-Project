# Numerical-Optimization-Simulation-Project

- The purpose of this project was to demonstrate one of the methods learned in class pertaining to a maximization/minimization problem. I chose a non-deterministic technique called the Simulated Annealing. Specifically, I chose the boltzman function to minimize the "punishment score" that I created.
Class project Fall 2018

- docx contains final paper
- R code is sectioned by topic
